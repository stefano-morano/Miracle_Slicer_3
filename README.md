Choose the audio file clicking the folder button and load it clicking the button next.

Use the left button to draw slice and the right button to select regions. You can manipulate the attack and the release of the single region and also reverse it.

With the toggle switch, you can active the automatic on set recogniser and modify the threshold with the relative knob.

You can also change the pitch, the pan and the master volume.

When you have your slicer ready, you can play the loops with your computer keyboard or with a MIDI keyboard

### WARNING
 You have to connect your midi keyboard before the use of Miracle Slicer 3: if you connect it while you are in the website, you have to refresh it.
